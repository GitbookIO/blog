During the last month, more than a thousand books have been published to GitBook, today we are releasing an OPDS feed to browse the GitBook library.

The **Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS)** is an application of the Atom Syndication Format intended to enable content creators and distributors to distribute digital books via a simple catalog format. This format is designed to work interchangeably across multiple desktop and device software programs.

From your OPDS compatible application, simply add [https://www.gitbook.com/api/opds/catalog.atom](https://www.gitbook.com/api/opds/catalog.atom) as a catalog.

So take it for a spin with these compatible mobile readers:

- [Aldiko Book Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aldiko.android) (**For Android**)
- [BlueFire](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bluefire-reader/id394275498?mt=8) (**For iOS**)
- [Bookviser](http://bookviser.com) (**For Windows Phone and Windows 8**)
