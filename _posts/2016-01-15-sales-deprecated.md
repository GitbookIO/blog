Paid books and landing pages are now deprecated features and will be removed in 30 days (14th of February 2016).

<!-- more -->

We decided to deprecate these features, so that we can focus on what makes GitBook special. Helping teams and individuals write, publish and manage their content collaboratively.

#### Sell your GitBook on Gumroad

Moving forward, paid books will be replaced by superior 3rd party integrations. We're providing a migration path to existing users through a first [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) integration.

[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com)'s mission is to help creators sell their digital work and grow their audience. Enabling GitBook users to make a private GitBook available for sale on Gumroad.

Paid books on GitBook.com will be converted to private books (for free), and existing customers will keep their read access thanks to [Access Keys](http://developer.gitbook.com/books/keys/index.html).

If you need help setting up your paid book on GumRoad, please [contact us](https://www.gitbook.com/contact).

#### Landing Pages

Custom landing pages [were introduced over a year ago](https://www.gitbook.com/blog/features/landing) as a marketing feature, allowing Authors to showcase their paid books using a personalized page.

Landing pages were deprecated a few months ago, but are now officially deprecated alongside paid books. In 30 days, all landing pages will be redirected to your book's homepage.

[We are available](https://www.gitbook.com/contact) to help authors transition their landing page to an hosting solution such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) (using the same theme, custom domain, etc).

#### Moving forward

Deprecating these features allows us to stay focused, and move faster on building the best platform to write and collaborate on content.

Stay tuned !
