Landing Pages and Selling Books on GitBook are now deprecated features and will be removed in 30 days.

<!-- more -->

GitBook.com started with the goal to become a complete marketplace to publish and sell content. During the last year and a half, GitBook evolves with its users, and it became clear authors were not looking for GitBook as a solution to sell books, but as a solution to write, publish and manage their content collaboratively.

#### Sell your GitBook on Gumroad

Selling books on GitBook.com is now deprecated, and will be completely disabled in 30 days (It's already no longer possible to create a paid book). It is replaced by a better integration with [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com).

[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) mission is to help creators sell their work and grow their audience. The new integration allows GitBook authors to makes a private book available to sell on Gumroad, they can write on GitBook and market the book on Gumroad.

Paid books on GitBook.com will be converted to private books (for free), and existing customers will keep a read access to the book using [Access Keys](http://developer.gitbook.com/books/keys/index.html).

We'll help authors of paid books transfer setup their books on Gumroad, you can [contact us using this form](https://www.gitbook.com/contact).

#### Landing Pages

Landing Page customization [was introduced more than a year ago](https://www.gitbook.com/blog/features/landing) as a Marketing feature, allowing Authors to showcase their paid books using a personnalizable page.

Since a few months, it was no longer possible to setup a landing page for a book. Today, as along with the paid books, we are officially deprecating this feature.

In 30 days, these pages will redirect to the details page of your book.

[We are available](https://www.gitbook.com/contact) to help authors transition these homepages to an hosting solution such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) (using the same theme, custom domain, etc).

#### Moving forward

Deprecating these features allows us to stay focus, and move faster on building the best platform to write and collaborate on content.

Stay tuned !
