Today we’re excited to release Webhooks. A simple but powerful way for developers to extend GitBook.com!

### Webhooks

Webhooks are an easy way to send information from one app to another. Starting today, authors can configure webhooks in their book settings.

Once you've added a webhook, `GitBook.com` will deliver a payload over a HTTP POST, for each subscribed event. The "deliveries" panel helps you track and troubleshoot webhook payloads.

### Slack Integration

Along with Webhooks we are releasing our first integration: **Slack**.

Our Slack integration posts updates and your book's overall activity to a channel of your choice. Instructions on how to install and use this integration can be found in the GitHub repository: [GitbookIO/services-slack](https://github.com/GitbookIO/services-slack). Pull requests and feedback are welcome !

### Build your own gitbook service

You might already have a few ideas of cool features that could be built with WebHooks! WebHooks are simple but incredibly flexible you could build anything from a serialized publishing mailing list to a gitbook linter (that highlights stylistic regressions) or pretty much anything else !

If you feel inspired, take a look at the slack integration and get coding :)
