Today, weâ€™re excited to announce Webhooks. It comes with a rich feature set providing developers the necessary tools to build integrations.

### Webhooks

Webhooks are an easy way to send information from one app to another. Starting today, authors can configure webhooks in their book settings.

Once you've configured a hook, we'll deliver an HTTP POST with a descriptive payload for each subscribed events. The deliveries section helps you track and troubleshoot a webhook event payload.

### Slack Integration

Along with Webhooks, we are also releasing our first integration: **Slack**.

This Slack integration will post updates and overall activity to a channel of your choosing in Slack. Instructions on how to install and use this integration can be found in the GitHub repository: [GitbookIO/services-slack](https://github.com/GitbookIO/services-slack).

This integration is also open source, and is a good example of how to build integrations with GitBook.com.
