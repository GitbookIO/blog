Get control over the Gitbook automatic building system to perfectly suit your needs thanks to the new branches whitelist option !

### Have what you need

[Automatic builds]({{ site.url }}features/build-branches) is an essential part of the Gitbook workflow. This great feature allows for easy collaborative work as your different branches are automatically built when your book is updated.

Today, Gitbook makes it better as you can specify only a set of branches to build on updates. The new **Building Specific Branches** setting is already available in the *Publication* pane of your book's settings.

After this upgrade, all your branches are selected by default. From here, you can then easily **whitelist** any number of branches, from one to all.

So start browsing, make your selection and have the work done ! :)
