GitHub just makes it easier to create and host a GitBook on it.

GitHub just added GitBook to their list of gitignore templates. When creating a repository for your book on GitHub, you can now select the GitBook template to make it faster and easier to setup your book repository.

Hosting your book source on GitHub is a good way to make it easy for readers to contribute to it (issues, pull requests, etc). From your book settings, you can link a GitHub repository to your book and add a webhook to build automatically when you're pushing to GitHub.
