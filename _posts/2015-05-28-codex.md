[CODEX Hackathon](http://codexhackathon.com/) is a gathering of folks who want to imagine the future of books and reading. Programmers, designers, writers, librarians, publishers, readers. All are welcome.

The CODEX theme is "connecting" â€” connecting around books, connecting readers and authors, connecting libraries.

It will take place over the weekend of June 26-28 in San Francisco, the opening reception will be at the GitHub HQ and the hackathon at Code for America.

### Hack with our APIs

The CODEX Hackaton is a great opportunity to learn more about our APIs, and to build great applications on top of them together. Our APIs include:

* **REST API** to create/update/manage books on our platform
* **OPDS feed** and search/explore API that covers over 7,000 books published on our platform
* **GitBook plugins** and our open source book format/toolchain
* **Rousseau REST API** to proofread and spellcheck

### Join us at CODEX

If you're a developer, a designer or simply passionate about books, join us at CODEX for a weekend full of code, fun and innovation, you can [register here](http://codexhackathon.com/).

We are lucky to have a great international community and we know travelling can be expensive so we're offering the chance to win one trip to San Francisco (and the Codex Hackathon of course) and we'll cover your travel expenses (up to $1200).

**How to be participate**: Tweet an idea that you would like to build/explore during the hackathon, mention `@GitbookIO` and `#codex` in your tweet.

**The winner** will be chosen amongst the best/craziest ideas!

For example (the killer app Apple Watch has been waiting for):

> An app to write and publish books from your Apple Watch through @GitbookIO #codex

We'll announce the lucky winner on the 8th of June, so we wish you all the best of luck brainstorming and tweeting !

We look forward to seeing you there !
