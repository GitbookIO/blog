### New Design

The book reader now has a new and improved design that brings more focus to the content. This new UI also brings more sharing options (such as Weibo and Instapaper).

Configuration for sidebar has links changed (to be more flexible), see [docs](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook#how-to-use-it) for more info.

### Kramdown

Starting with version 1.0.0, our goal is to bring more and more support of the [Kramdown syntax](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

This version already brings support for footnotes and inline mathematics.

### Glossary

GitBook now supports glossaries; designed using gitbook’s two core philosophies, simplicity and automation, our glossary support automatically builds the index for each term and highlights them inline, to save any additional unnecessary work :).

The `GLOSSARY.md` format is very simple :

```markdown
# term
Definition for this term

# Another term
With it's definition, this can contain bold text and all other kinds of inline markup ...
```

### Exercises and quizzes

Exercises and quizzes are now managed by plugins that need to be enabled in your book.json file:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "exercises", “quizzes”
    ]
}
```

### 7000 stars! :birthday:

The [GitBook syntax](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) just passed the 7000 star mark on GitHub. Thanks to all your love and help ! :+1:

### What’s up next ?

A better editor, the desktop editor will get a lot of love over the next few weeks.

Improvements for PDF and ebooks are also in the pipeline.

### Book updates to 1.0.0

All books hosted on **gitbook.io** will progressively be updated to the new `1.0.0` as we roll it out over the next few days. So stay tuned !
