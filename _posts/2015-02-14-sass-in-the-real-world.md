Joining the Gitbook community can be a real game changer for authors willing to embrace the digital era. Dale Sande and Kianosh Pourian experienced it when they decided in june 2014 to publish a series of tech related publications featuring education on web design.

*Sass in the real world*, a series of 4 books, is a focus on web-design using Sass meant to gather in one publication all the essentials of Sass stylesheet language development. The Gitbook platform has allowed them to keep control over the content of the two publications that have already been commercialized. They plan on publishing two more in the following months.

Dale is very involved in the Sass community as a core contributor to SassMeister and also the author of an advanced video course on [TreeHouse](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/new-course-advanced-sass). He splits his time between San Francisco where he works as a UI Architect for AppDirect and Seattle where he is a Front-End Developer instructor for Code Fellows.

It is always interesting to understand how actual users perceive a product. In Dale’s case, publishing on Gitbook has proven to be as easy as publishing an application. As a writer he can focus on the essential: writing. The numerous features available on the website provide all the support necessary making the process of editing accessible to anyone.

Whether you are looking to write, publish or distribute a selection of features will be available to guide you in your journey as a digital author. From day one, Dale and Kianosh were quickly able to put their book together using the editor and end up with an ebook ready to sell. Coupon codes for example provided them with an efficient way to promote the book within different communities (Dale’s students, etc...). For their second publication the [mailing](http://help.gitbook.com/platform/mailing.html) feature integrated in GitBook along with coupon codes made it easy to promote the new book to readers of the first volume.

According to Dale, all of these components are making Gitbook an easy and efficient platform to work with.

We are really proud to count Dale and Kianosh amongst our authors and wish them the best for their upcoming projects; we can't wait finishing learning about Sass with *Sass in the real world*!
