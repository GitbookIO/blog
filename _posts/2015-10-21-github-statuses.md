GitBook now displays beautiful status indicators on your GitHub Pull-Requests.

<!-- more -->

![Commit statuses]({{ site.url }}assets/2015-10-21-github-statuses.png)

Starting today, GitBook updates the build status on your GitHub pull requests.

Once you open a PR, we update it's status as the build progresses. When the build passes or fails you'll get a small link back to our build details.

You can even set it as a required status check to ensure that nobody merges a PR breaking your documentation :)

Overall this a small but useful feature, making it easier than ever to merge a pull request without having to worry about breaking changes.
