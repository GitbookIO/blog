GitBook now automatically update pull-request status on GitHub.

<!-- more -->

![Commit statuses]({{ site.url }}assets/2015-10-21-github-statuses.png)

Starting today, GitBook will update the build status on your GitHub pull requests, for books that are integrated with GitHub.

After you open a PR, we update its status in GitHub with a pass/fail status, and a link back to our build details. You can even set it as a required status check to ensure that only PRs meeting your organizationâ€™s standards are merged in protected branches.
