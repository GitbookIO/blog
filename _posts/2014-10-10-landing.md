### Landing page and theme

The greatest improvement of today's release is the addition of landing page and themes for books. This feature lets you customize your book homepage using a pre-defined theme or your own custom HTML.

Themes can be published and testable from the index at [www.gitbook.io/themes](https://www.gitbook.io/themes). Books are using a default theme that we are maintening.

### Custom domains

Books content were already able to be accessed using a custom domain name. But we are now bringing custom domain names for the homepage itself.
This feature lets you bring more personnal branding to your book by using a specific and personalized url.

When a homepage domain name is specified, content is accessed at `http://yourdomainname.com/content/` (this url is ovverided by the settings to define a content domain name).
