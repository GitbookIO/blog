Authors can now customize their book's homepage with personalized branding and custom domain names.

### Landing page and themes

The greatest improvement of today's release is the addition of landing pages and themes. This feature lets you customize your book's homepage using a pre-defined theme or your own custom HTML.

Themes can be published and tested from the index at [www.gitbook.io/themes](https://www.gitbook.io/themes). Landing pages by default will use a default theme that we are maintaining.

### Custom domains

A book's content could already be accessed through a custom domain name. But we are now bringing custom domain names for the homepage itself.

**Note:** When a homepage domain name is specified, content is accessed at `http://yourdomainname.com/content/` (this url is overridden if you define a custom content domain).
