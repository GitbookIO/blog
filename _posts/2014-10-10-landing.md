### Landing page and theme

The greatest improvement of today's release is the addition of landing page and theme for books. This feature lets you customize your book homepage using a pre-defined theme or your own custom HTML.

### Custom domains

Books content were already able to be accessed using a custom domain name. But we are now bringing custom domain names for the homepage itself.
This feature lets you bring more personnal branding to your book by using a specific and personalized url.

When a homepage domain name is specified, content is accessed at `http://yourdomainname.com/content/` (this url is ovverided by the settings to define a content domain name).

### New Dashboard

We are introducing a new dashboard for each of your books. This dashboard lets you quickly access all the important tools to manage your book.
