Today we are annoucing a huge improvement on our search tools

<!-- more -->

![Search]({{ site.url }}assets/2014-12-20-search.png)

You can now search using powerful filters. These filters let you:

* **Filter books by license:** [license:"apache-2"](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=license%3A%22apache-2%22)
* **Filter books by language:** [language:en](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=language%3Aen)

The parsing of search queries is done by a Node.js module that we open sourced on GitHub: [GitbookIO/filterable](https://github.com/GitbookIO/filterable).
