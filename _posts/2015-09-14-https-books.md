Starting today, we're enabling HTTPS for all books served on gitbook.com.

<!-- more -->

By default books and homepages are served under `username.gitbooks.io/book/`. These books can now be accessed over HTTPS, thus providing a more reliable and secure experience to readers, while also improving SEO.

HTTPS isn't enabled for books using custom domains, this isn't yet possible for technical reasons. That might change in a few months thanks to the Linux Foundation's [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) effort.
