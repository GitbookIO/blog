Starting today, books homepages and content on gitbooks.io will be served over HTTPS.

<!-- more -->

Books content and homepage are by default served under `username.gitbooks.io/book/`. We've now enabled SSL connection to these hostname. This will provide a more secure and reliable experience to the readers, and also improve SEO.

HTTPS is only working for books using default domain name, if your book is using a custom domain name, it currently can't be served under HTTPS.
