2014 has been GitBook's first year. In just a few months, weâ€™ve grown to a community of over 20,000 authors (and growing), reaching more than half a million ebook downloads and ten millions book views.

We're grateful to all our users that are part of this journey with us, we're improving the writing experience for thousands of authors thanks to your feedback and support. 2015 has just begun and a full year of progress awaits us as a product and as a community.

Let's make 2015 an awesome year for authors and GitBook.

2014 has been a crazy but wonderful year, it's crazy to think that at the beginning of this year GitBook didn't even exist, and in just about 6 months it's progressed from an idea to a fully functional product helping thousands of authors daily.

Let's take a look back at 2014 and what we've accomplished together, before seeing what awaits in 2015 :

### 2014
* **May** : Samy and I release the open [GitBook format and toolchain](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), prototyped over a weekend. But quickly matures thanks to your input and contributions.
* **(early) June** : We release the **GitBook Editor** for Windows, Linux and Mac
* **(late)  June** : We launch `GitBook.io`, a platform to host and build gitbooks
