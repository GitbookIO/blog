We just released the version `2.0.0` of [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook). This version includes many improvements and some sizeable changes.

<!-- more -->

### Template Engine

The version 2.0.0 introduces a template engine before the markup parsers. This template engine is based on Nunjucks by Mozilla, the syntax is inspired by jinja2:

![Process of GitBook 2.0.0]({{ site.url }}assets/2015-02-02-process.png)


This template engine lets you use and include variables from your `book.json` configuration:

```
This is my {{ book.myVariable }}.
```

More informations about it are available on our [documentation]().

### AsciiDoc, reStructuredText parsers

Support for other markup language than Markdown was a highly requested feature. The version 2.0.0 removes the unique dependence to Markdown to bring support to AsciiDoc and reStructuredText; these two parsers are currently in alpha version and will be improved during the evolution of the 2.x.x version.

### Content References: Internal and External

Authors really wanted to use "content references," or conrefs, when writing documentation. A conref allows you to write a chunk of text once and reuse it throughout the book. (The idea was borrowed from the DITA standard.)

```
{% include ".myFile.md" %}
```

It also supports include files from other git using a git reference:

```
{% include "git+https://github.com/GitbookIO/documentation.git/README.md#1.0.1" %}
```

More informations about this feature are available on our [documentation]().

### Better support of images in eBook formats (SVG, ...)

This releases handle in a much more betteer way images when converting the book to eBook (pdf, epub and mobi). Remote images are downloaded locally and integrated as local files during the build, and SVG images are converted to PNG automatically (Inline SVGs are also supported).

### Math in eBook formats

The [MathJax plugin](https://github.com/GitbookIO/plugin-mathjax) was been improved to support ebook formats. Mathematics in your book will be converted to SVG when using ebook formats (pdf, epub and mobi), then converted to PNG by GitBook itself.

### How to test GitBook 2.0.x on GitBook.com

Till the version 2.0.0 is not a stable release, you can test and check that your book is building correctly with it by switching the builder to "Version 2.0.0" in your book settings.
