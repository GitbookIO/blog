Authors can now create a book pre-filled for special use-cases.

![Template Selection]({{ site.url }}assets/2014-12-02-book-templates.png)

GitBook is being used for many cases: roman, programming book, science book, thesis, etc. 

Starting today, authors can select when creating a book a template that suits their needs. Four different templates are introduced today:
* **Base**: a one-page book
* **Science**: a book pre-configured to run and render math
* **Exercises**: a book pre-configured to render interactive programming exercises
* **Quizzes**: a book pre-configured to render interactive quizzes

We hope to see more use cases in the future, and we'll be happy to introduce more templates!
