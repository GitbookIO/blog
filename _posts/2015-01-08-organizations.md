Many authors use GitBook as part of a team (company/university/...) collaboratively authoring books or documentation together. A highly requested feature was to be able structure those teams inside GitBook, this is now possible !

Quite a few of you had been asking for this feature for a while and had been using workarounds, such as creating a seperate account for the organization, so with that in mind not only is it easy to create new organizations, but you can easily convert old (user) accounts to an organization !

If you want to check out the specifics, you can read through [our documentation regarding organizations](http://help.gitbook.io/platform/organizations/README.html), it covers everything you need to get started : [converting user accounts](http://help.gitbook.io/platform/organizations/convert.html), [transferring ownership](http://help.gitbook.io/platform/organizations/ownership.html), etc ...

We hope you'll enjoy this feature and that it will boost you and your colleagues productivity.

As usual if you have any feedback or ideas you would like to share, we would love to hear them !
You can reach us through our [contact form](https://www.gitbook.com/contact) or by email.
