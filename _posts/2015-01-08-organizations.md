Many authors use GitBook as part of a team (company/university/...) collaboratively authoring books or documentation together. A highly requested feature was to be able structure those teams inside GitBook, this is now possible !

<!-- more -->

If you've ever had to manage multiple GitBook accounts, desired a team-specific dashboard or needed to share multiple books with your team, you're going to love Organizations.

### A home for your organization's books

Creating an organization helps you centralize your organization's books. All books live under the organization, collaborators are managed in a single place and billing goes through a central organization account.

Any owner of an organization may edit that organization's settings, from profile details to billing information.

### Transforming an existing user account into an organization

Quite a few of you had been asking for this feature for a while and had been using workarounds, such as creating a seperate account for the organization, so with that in mind not only is it easy to create new organizations, but you can easily convert old (user) accounts to an organization !

If you want to check out the specifics, you can read through [our documentation regarding organizations](http://help.gitbook.io/platform/organizations/README.html), it covers everything you need to get started : [converting user accounts](http://help.gitbook.io/platform/organizations/convert.html), [transferring ownership](http://help.gitbook.io/platform/organizations/ownership.html), etc ...

### Get started with Organizations today

We hope you'll enjoy this feature and that it will boost you and your colleagues productivity.
