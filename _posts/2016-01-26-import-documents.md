Migrating to GitBook.com has never been that easy !

<!-- more -->

Starting today, importing your existing documents on GitBook.com is as simple as creating a new book.

The new import feature can also be used on empty books.

Using the [gitbook-convert](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-convert) node module, this feature will automatically generate markdown files from your document, including the summary.
