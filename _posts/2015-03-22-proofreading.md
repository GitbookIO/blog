### English Proofreading

Proofreading is important for all types of authors, integrated in the web-editor, it highlights common errors such as wordy sentences, adverbs, passive voice, complicated words.

Proofreading is done in the editor using a lightweight library called [Rousseau](https://github.com/GitbookIO/rousseau), this library is open source and published on [GitHub](https://github.com/GitbookIO/rousseau).

Feel free to contribute to this library to add support for more checks or languages.

### 30 new dictionaries

2 months ago, we introduced spellchecking with support for 5 languages; this new version brings support for 30 new dicitonaries including: Russian, Greek, Portuguese, ...

### Faster than ever

This new version of the editor is also much more faster, preview has been improved to only reflect modifications. This enhances writing experience for all authors.
