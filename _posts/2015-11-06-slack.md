### Webhooks

Webhooks are now available for books on GitBook.com.


### Slack Integration

Along with Webhooks, we are also releasing our first integration: **Slack**.

This Slack integration will post updates and overall activity to a channel of your choosing in Slack.

It is open source, feel free to contribute on GitHub: [github.com/GitbookIO/services-slack](https://github.com/GitbookIO/services-slack).
