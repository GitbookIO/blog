### Webhooks

Webhooks are now available for books on GitBook.com.


### Slack Integration

Along with Webhooks, we are also releasing our first integration: **Slack**.

This Slack integration will post updates and overall activity to a channel of your choosing in Slack. Instructions on how to install and use this integration can be found in the GitHub repository: [GitbookIO/services-slack](https://github.com/GitbookIO/services-slack).
