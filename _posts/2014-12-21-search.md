Today we are annoucing a big improvement to our search service. We are now following GitHub and Google's search query syntax to empower you to run advanced queries and compose filters.

![Search]({{ site.url }}assets/2014-12-21-search.png)

Here's a few examples of searches enabled by this new query system:

### Field equality Queries

* **Filter books by license:** [license:"apache-2"](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=license%3A%22apache-2%22)
* **Filter books by language:** [language:en](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=language%3Aen)

### Greater Than Queries

* **Filter books by views:** [views:>90000](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=views%3A%3E90000)

### Less Than Queries

* **Filter books by views:** [views:<90000](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=views%3A%3C90000)

### Mix filters

* **Filter books by license and language:** [language:en license:apache-2](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=language%3Aen+license%3Aapache-2)
* **Filter books by a range of views:** [views:<200000 views:>90000](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=views%3A%3C200000+views%3A%3E90000)
* **Books in Chinese with more than 100,000 views:** [language:zh views:>100000](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=language%3Azh+views%3A%3E100000)

More information about the query syntax can be found in the [documentation](http://help.gitbook.io/platform/search.html).

The parsing of queries is done by a `node.js` module that we've open sourced on GitHub: [GitbookIO/filterable](https://github.com/GitbookIO/filterable). (PRs are more than welcome).
