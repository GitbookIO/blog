Today we are annoucing a huge improvement on our search tools. We are now following the GitHub and Google search query syntax to filter results.

You can now search using powerful filters. These filters let you:

### Field equality Queries

* **Filter books by license:** [license:"apache-2"](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=license%3A%22apache-2%22)
* **Filter books by language:** [language:en](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=language%3Aen)

### Greater Than Queries

* **Filter books by views:** [views:>90000](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=views%3A%3E90000)

### Less Than Queries

* **Filter books by views:** [views:<90000](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=views%3A%3C90000)

### Mix filters

* **Filter books by license and language:** [language:en license:apache-2](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=language%3Aen+license%3Aapache-2)
* **Filter books by a range of views:** [views:<200000 views:>90000](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=views%3A%3C200000+views%3A%3E90000)
* **Books in Chinese with more than 100,000 views:** [language:zh views:>100000](https://www.gitbook.com/search?q=language%3Azh+views%3A%3E100000)

More information about the query syntax can be found in the [documentation](http://help.gitbook.io/platform/search.html).

The parsing of search queries is done by a Node.js module that we open sourced on GitHub: [GitbookIO/filterable](https://github.com/GitbookIO/filterable).
