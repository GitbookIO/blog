It was already possible to add math in your book using the **MathJax** plugin. Since version **1.0.0**, the editor shows you [realtime renders of your equations](https://www.gitbook.io/blog/releases/editor-1-0-0#math-equation-previews).

GitBook includes parsing of TeX separeated by `$$`:

```markdown
$$
The quadratic formula is $$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$$
$$
```

Using MathJax, TeX markup are only rendered on the website version of the book.
