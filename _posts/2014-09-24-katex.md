KaTex can now be used instead of MathJax for math typesetting.

It was already possible to add math in your book using the **MathJax** plugin. Since version **1.0.0**, the editor shows you [realtime renders of your equations](https://www.gitbook.io/blog/releases/editor-1-0-0#math-equation-previews).

GitBook includes parsing of TeX separeated by `$$`:

```markdown
The quadratic formula is $$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$$
```

But using MathJax, TeX markup are only rendered on the website version of the book. Last month, **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)** introduces [KaTeX](http://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), a fast math typesetting library.

**KaTeX** is a great initiative, so that we decided to build a [plugin for GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/plugin-katex) to integrates this library to render TeX markup. You can add this plugin directly from the editor using the menu `Book > Plugins > New Plugin` and enter `katex`, you will need to run the installation process using the menu `Book > Plugins > Install Plugins`.

Using latest version of GitBook (**1.1.0**, now available on gitbook.io), the KaTeX plugin is also working on ebooks formats (epub and pdf).
