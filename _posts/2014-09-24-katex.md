GitBook now supports KaTeX as a replacement to MathJax, giving you beautiful pre-rendered math that is eBook compatible!

It was already possible to add math to your books using the **MathJax** plugin. In fact, since version **1.0.0**, the editor would preview [realtime renders of your equations](https://www.gitbook.io/blog/releases/editor-1-0-0#math-equation-previews).

GitBook includes parsing of TeX delimited by `$$`:

```markdown
The quadratic formula is $$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$$
```

Up until now, rendering TeX required loading MathJax (heavy), this did not work well for eBooks. However, last month **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)** introduced [KaTeX](http://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), a fast math typesetting library capable of pre-rendering TeX.

**KaTeX** is a great initiative, so we decided to build a [KaTeX GitBook plugin](https://github.com/GitbookIO/plugin-katex) that leverages KaTeX to pre-render TeX markup. You can add this plugin directly from the editor using the menu `Book > Plugins > New Plugin` and by entering `katex`, you will need to run the installation process using the menu `Book > Plugins > Install Plugins` to make your changes effective.

Using latest version of GitBook (**1.1.0**, now available on gitbook.io), you will now be able to leverage the KaTeX plugin across all your ebooks (epub, mobi and pdf).
