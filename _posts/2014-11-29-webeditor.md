After the native editor for GitBook, we are now releasing a web editor fully integrated with the GitBook platform and GitHub.

GitBook's desktop editor (supporting Mac, Windows and Linux), was a success, loved and cherrished by thousands of authors, however many authors wanted the simplicity and convenience (no-installation) of a web editor, and as a result of that feedback, we went a built an awesome web editor !

### Edit all your books

The web editor fully supports the GitBook format. You can edit the summary using drag and drop, edit your glossary terms, and even create and manage multiple translations from the same workspace.

The editor has great GitHub integration (for the technical writers & programmers), and can natively edit books hosted on GitHub. To do so, link your GitHub repository to your book and enable the deployment webhook.

### Typecheck, Distraction free mode, ...

This version has been made to simplify and enhance your writing experience. Built in typecheck helps spot spelling mistakes before you save and the distraction free mode lets you focus on your content.

### Git Integration

Versioning is a godsend that developers and advanced writers can not live without. We're bringing that powerful versioning technology (Git) as a first class citizen inside this new editor, you will now be able to create, merge, delete branches till you drop ! Versioning will provide you with a complete history/log of all you work, helping you be more organized while also enabling collaboration.

### What about the desktop editor?

We will no longer continue to develop the desktop editor, the source code is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/GitbookIO/editor). This desktop editor was built using HTML5/NodeJS technologies with node-webkit. But we are planning on releasing in the coming months a fully native pro version of the editor.
