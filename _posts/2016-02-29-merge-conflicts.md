Stuck editing a book because of the infamous ['Can not fast forward'](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/issues/1117) error ? Fortunately, this should never happen again.

# Collaborate more, without problem

The version 5 of the editor will make collaboration on books even more seamless.
The new conflict resolution feature let several authors edit the same file at the same time, without encountering errors because of conflicts. Likewise, this feature allows merging of any branches, even if they have conflicting differences.

# Conflicts happen

Because GitBook allows authors to collaborate on a book, and keeps at
the same time an history of all changes, it sometimes has to deal with
changes on a same piece of text, made by different authors. This can happen when trying to merge two conflicting branches, or when several authors edit a branch at the same time. So far, this would result in [an error](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/issues/1117) and you were left stuck. Now you are given a way to handle these conflicts.

# Resolving conflicts

When conflicts happen, you are brought to a screen that let you
compare the two versions of a file, review and resolve the conflicts
between them, and submit a final version. The process is the same
whether you were merging two conflicting branches, or you and another
author made simultaneous changes.
