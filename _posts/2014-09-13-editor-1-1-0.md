### Important: Download the latest release now

This release fixes a bug in the update checking. This bug makes it impossible for releases `1.0.x` to signal a new version.

### Distraction free mode

This new release lets you customize the layout to stay more focus on your content. By triggering `Cmd-Shift-F` on Mac or `Ctrl-Shift-F` on Linux/Windows, the summary and preview panels will be hidden. You can also hide specific panel from the `View` menu.

### Other features

This version also includes some minor features like the ability to read the ChangeLog from the "File" menu, more options for the editor (show/hide invisible characters, line height, ...), and some improvements for the preview on the browser (open current section, etc.).

### Bugs Fixes

Like always, we are fixing bugs and improving your overall experience on the editor:

- **Math context menu**: we disabled the context menu on math elements to avoid a crash that locks the editor application.
- **Book Configuration**: we fixed the JSON edition dialog, to handle errors in a smoother way.
- **Normalization on auto-save**: In the 1.0.0 release, we intoduced the auto-save functionnality; this feature coupled with the noramlization features (whitespaces and end-of-line) was troubleshooting the writing experience.
