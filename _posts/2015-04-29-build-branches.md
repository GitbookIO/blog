GitBook now automatically builds branches, a great feature for teams working with multiple branches at once.

Branch builds not only work within GitBook but also for branches pushed from GitHub, a real plus for those fond of our GitHub integration.

### Preview

You can now preview work done on a branch before merging it to master, making it easier to review a collaborator's contributions our work on temporary branches.

### What's next ?

This feature by itself is rather small but lays the grounds for advanced git powered collaboration features that we plan to roll out over the coming weeks.

Stay tuned !
