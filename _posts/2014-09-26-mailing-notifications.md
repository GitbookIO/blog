Since last month, Authors [have a full fledged dashboard](https://www.gitbook.io/blog/features/author-subscriber-mailing) to send custom messages to their subscribers, those messages can be promotions of new books, content updates, etc â€¦

Starting from now, for paid books, readers will automatically be added to the mailing list of your book. That's allow you to be able to send message to all the people you bought your book.

We are also introducing at the same time "Notification messages", this feature let you define a message as a notification that will be send to each new reader of a paid book.
This message can for example include a "thank you note", or a promotion to another book.
