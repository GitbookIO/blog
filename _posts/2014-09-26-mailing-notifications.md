Since last month, Authors [have a full fledged dashboard](https://www.gitbook.io/blog/features/author-subscriber-mailing) to send custom messages to their subscribers, those messages can be promote of new books, content updates, etc â€¦

Starting from now, readers will automatically be added to your book's mailing list. This will allow you as an author to reach out to all the readers who have purchased your book.

We're also releasing **"Notification messages"**, that will send an automatic e-mail to your reader as soon as they purchase your book, with a custom message of your choice !

Use it to send out "thank you notes, or leverage it as a great source of feedback and a means to be closer to your readers
