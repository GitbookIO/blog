As [expected](https://www.gitbook.com/blog/infos/year-review), 2015 has been a busy but incredible year for GitBook, we've grown to a community of ~100,000 authors

### 2015 in Review

* **GitBook Format/Toolchain** : We released the version 2.0 of the format, much more [extensible](https://plugins.gitbook.com)
* **GitBook Editor** : We release a new **GitBook Editor** for Web Browser, Windows, Linux and Mac; [we are working hard](https://www.gitbook.com/blog/releases/editor-5-beta) on making the editor a pleasure to use.
