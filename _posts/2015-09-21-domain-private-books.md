HTTPS is now enabled for private and paid books served on gitbook.com !

<!-- more -->

Public books and homepages are served under `https://username.gitbooks.io/book/`. We're now enabling these domains for private and paid books, allowing for a more reliable and secure reading experience.

Private and paid books can also link a custom domain to serve content. Add your custom domain name in your book settings, then point your [DNS to GitBook](https://help.gitbook.com/platform/domains.html).

HTTPS isn't enabled for books using custom domains, this isn't yet possible for technical reasons. That might change in a few months thanks to the Linux Foundation's [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) effort.
