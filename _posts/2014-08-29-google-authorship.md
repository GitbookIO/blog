Google today announced that it has stopped showing the names of authors in its search results.

![Example of results with Google Authorship]({{ site.url }}assets/2014-08-29-google-authorship.jpeg)

Before today, GitBook let you use your Google+ connected account to show your name with your books in Google search results. But Google [has completely dropped all authorship functionality](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JohnMueller/posts/HZf3KDP1Dm8) from the search results and webmaster tools.

Since this meta information will no longer be used by Google and other search engines, we decided to remove your implementation of Google Authorship.
Google+ Profile connected to GitBook will still be used to link your user profile to your Google+ profile.
