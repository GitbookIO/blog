Google today announced that it will be removing Google Authorship from search results.

Up until today, GitBook allowed you to connect your Google+ account to show your name alongside your books in Google search results. But Google [has completely dropped all authorship functionality](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JohnMueller/posts/HZf3KDP1Dm8) from the search results and webmaster tools.

Since this meta information will no longer be used by Google and other search engines, we have decided to drop our implementation of Google Authorship.
Google+ Profiles connected to GitBook will still be used to link your user profile to your Google+ profile.
