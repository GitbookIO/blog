Readers can now contact authors directly from their book homepages.

![Contact Author]({{ site.url }}assets/2014-10-19-contact.png)

Begining today, readers and visitors are able to contact authors using the button "Contact" in the top right corner of each book homepages.

The visitor will be redirected to a contact form, where he can enter his name, email address and message. The message will be parsed as **Markdown**.

Messages from the contact form are sent by email to the main author of the book. You can reply directly to these emails to start a conversation with the visitor.
