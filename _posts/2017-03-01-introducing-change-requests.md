Today, we are releasing a major improvement for collaboration on GitBook.com: Change requests.

### Collaboration workflow for teams

When you're working on a book, you're going to have a bunch of changes or ideas in progress at any given time. Some of them are ready to be published, some are waiting to be reviewed by your collaborators, and others are just not ready at all.

Change Requests exist to help you manage this and keep a clean workflow.

Once you start using change requests, your workflow will become faster and more focused. Each change request will make a cohesive and distinct set of changes, that can be reviewed independently from others. Your published version will always stay polished and coherent. And you will have a high-level view of your book's evolution.

### Get started with change requests

Starting today, you can create a change request right from the web editor.
