### PayPal as a payment solution

Readers are now able to buy books using PayPal. They will be prompt to choose between paying using their credit card or their PayPal account.

Payments using PayPal are also for sure supported for donations.

### PayPal as a withdraw solution

You can also add your PayPal account as a withdraw solution, to do so simply go to your [settings](https://www.gitbook.io/settings/recipient/paypal) and enter your PayPal email address.
You will then be able to withdraw your fund directly to your PayPal account from the [transfers](http://localhost:5000/settings/transfers) page.

Fees will be apply during the transfer (2.9% + $0.30).

Being paid for GitBook with PayPal has never been easier or looked better, and we're hoping that no matter where you are in the world, you'll be able to use GitBook to write something great!
