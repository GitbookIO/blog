Teams are using GitBook to publish documentations, manuals, papers or books.; and collaboration is an important part of their workflow. Today we are introducing a new set of features to improve collaboration: Discussions and Inline-commenting.

#### Inline Comments


#### Discussions Dashboard

On book pages youâ€™ll now see an "Discussions" tab in the lateral menu. The discussions dashboard will let you easily start a new discussion, browse existing ones, comment or close discussions.
