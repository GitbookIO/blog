We now allow free/public books to be switched to paid and you can also update the prices of previously paid books.

<!-- more -->

You can do so from a book’s settings page (see screenshot below) :

This is a small addition, however it’s pretty useful when you’re finishing off your book and want to give a shot a monetizing it or to provide a temporary discounted price (take a look at our coupon system too).

Not a big feature, but one step further on our path to help you publish your books !
