GitBook 2.0.0 is maturing, transitioning from `alpha` to `beta` and will soon become the new stable. Featuring large improvements, bug fixes and a fair share of shiny new features !

<!-- more -->

A month ago, the `alpha` release introduced new features and improvements such as: [Content references](http://help.gitbook.com/format/conrefs.html), [Templating](http://help.gitbook.com/format/templating.html), [AsciiDoc Support](http://help.gitbook.com/format/asciidoc.html), better Internalization support (thanks to translations contributed by the community !) and others ...

Our [previous blog article](https://www.gitbook.com/blog/releases/version-2-0-0) discussed the big changes coming with the `2.0.0` release, check it out or the [ChangeLog on GitHub](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for a deeper understanding of the specifc changes to come.

Today we're releasing GitBook `2.0.0` as `beta` release, improving quality, stability and performance over the `alpha`, we're not far from it becoming `stable`. In fact, GitBook.com will switch to GitBook `2.0.0` as the default builder starting **March 18**.

Most books, if not all, will benefit of the `2.0.0.` release without any breaking changes. If you want to check for any breaking changes or take the `2.0.0` release for a spin: simply switch the builder in the your book's settings:

I hope you will appreciate the hard work that's gone into GitBook `2.0.0`, made possible thanks to the great feedback and input provided by our authors.

We'll keep you updated, in the meantime good luck with your GitBook !
