### WYSIWYG

This new version includes a better editor for Markdown, with WYSIWYG-like functionnalities: display math formulas, display images and links.

### Commit multiple files at once

A requested feature for the editor was the ability to commit multiple files at once and enter a custom commit message. It's now possible!

Authors can disable "Auto-commit" from the settings dialog. Once a file is modified, you can commit changes by clicking the "Commit" button and entering a short description of your changes.

### Download it!

This version is still a pre-release, that may be unstable. We appreciate [your feedback](https://www.gitbook.com/contact).
