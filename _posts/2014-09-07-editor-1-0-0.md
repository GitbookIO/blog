### Plugins

This release also ships with a plugin manager, you can add/remove/configure/install plugins.

### The future

Moving forward, we plan do add great improvements to the Editor's UX, making even further accessible and user friendly especially for non technical writers (so we will probably have a full WYSIWYG release at some point). And a mobile editor for iOS is on the on the roadmap :smile: !
