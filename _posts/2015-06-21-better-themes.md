Landing pages provide authors with well-crafted homepages to showcase their books, using a custom domain or their GitBook domain.

Our improved themes are cleaner, more responsive and mobile compatible.

We're also releasing a new default theme: **"readme"**, an elegant and minimalistic design centered around your book's readme.

#### How to enable landing pages ?

The landing page feature can be enabled in your book's settings, simply click the "Landing Page" icon from your book's dashboard (paint can icon).

#### Contribute and create your own theme

As always we are open to your input, you can create your own theme by submitting a PR to our GitHub repository: [GitbookIO/themes](https://github.com/GitbookIO/themes). Once your PR is merged, everyone will be able to enjoy the beautiful theme you crafted !
